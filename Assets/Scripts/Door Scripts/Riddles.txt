VIPER CLUES

I CREEP AND I CRAWL
I AM THE CAUSE OF THE FALL
I START REAL SMALL
I CAN GROW TO BE QUITE TALL
I AM QUITE DECEPTIVE
MAY DANGER IS NOT SUBJECTIVE
IF YOU SEE ME, HAVE CAUTION
SO YOU WON'T END UP IN A COFFIN

LIGHTNING CLUES


I PACK A REAL PUNCH, BUT I'M REAL LIGHT
WITH ME, THERE IS NO FIGHT
I CAN BRING FIRE
I CAN EVEN BRING SIGHT
I LIVE HIGH IN THE SKY
WAY ABOVE THE NESTS
I'LL TRY NOT TO TOUCH YOU
HOPEFULLY YOU WON'T BE NEXT

WATER CLUES
I GO WITH THE FLOW
IN ME, MANY ROW
SOME MAY GO FAST
OTHERS MAY GO SLOW
I CAN BE AS SMALL AS A PINKY
OR AS BIG AS THE MISSISSIPPI
DON'T LEAVE ME IN THE HEAT
OR I'LL LEAVE REAL QUICKLY

VULTURE CLUES
I CAN BE MIGHT FIESTY
MAYBE EVEN A PEST
YOU CAN HAVE FIRST SERVINGS
I'LL CLEAN THE REST
I LIVE REAL HIGH
I COMMUTE IN THE SKY
I'VE GOT A MIGHTY FINE EYE
EVEN MY HOME IS DRY

LION CLUES
I PARADE MY DWELLING 
WITH AUTHORITY AND MIGHT
PLEASE DO NOT COME NEAR
I'LL TRY NOT TO BITE
I COME TO LEAD
NEVER TO FOLLOW
I STAY WITH A TIGHT PACK
THAT NEVER GETS HOLLOW
